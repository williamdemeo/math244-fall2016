Learning Outcomes
-----------------

Upon successful completion of Math 244 the student will have an understanding of
the topics listed above, be able to solve routine problems, and be able to apply the ideas.

See the list of [Course Objectives](#course-objectives) below for more details.

------------------------------------------

Exams
-----
There will be three midterm exams each worth 15%, and a final exam worth 40%, of the course grade.

+ **MIDTERM EXAM 1** (focus tbd)  
**DATE:** Wednesday, September 19 (subject to change)  
  
+ **MIDTERM EXAM 2** (focus tbd)  
**DATE:** Wednesday, October 19 (subject to change)  

+ **MIDTERM EXAM 3** (focus tbd)  
**DATE:** Wednesday, November 16 (subject to change)  

+ **FINAL EXAM** (cumulative)  
**DATE:** Monday, December 12, 2016  
**TIME:** 12--2pm   
**LOCATION:** Keller 303

You must bring your UH student ID to every test. If Keller Hall is closed for any reason, we will meet by the steps of Hamilton Library. Only documented valid health related excuses will be accepted for missing an exam.

In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
the date of the final exam.

------------------------------------------

Homework
--------
**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  

Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the
tests, and ultimately to do well in the course.

The **homework will account for 15% of the course grade** and will be
assigned once per week, typically due each Friday **at the beginning of class.**
You must submit a hard copy of your homework.  Electronic documents
(e.g., email attachments) are not acceptable.

Homework submitted at the end of class on the due date will be penalized
10%. **Homework submitted after then end of class on the due date will not be
accepted or graded.**  

At least one (possibly more) of the lowest or missed homework scores
will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.
*The 10 best homework scores will count toward the final grade.*

------------------------------------------

Make-up Policy
--------------
**No late homework will be accepted for any reason.**  If you fail
to submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt
your course grade since the lowest homework scores will be dropped.

Generally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, 
if you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,
and if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,
then you might be able to take a make-up exam *before* the scheduled exam time.

To request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of
one of the following:

+ Documented medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.
+ Documented medical excuse - a member of the student's family has a medical emergency.
+ Extra curricular activities as a representative of University of Hawaii.
+ Armed forces deployment (military duty).
+ Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.
+ A conflict with another exam or if you have three or more final exams on a
  given day. (In each case the exam with the fewest students must arrange the make-up exam.)

If you miss an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).

------------------------------------------

Grading Policy
--------------
The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ Final exam: 40 points  
+ Mid-term exams: 45 points (15 each)  
+ Homework: 15 points total  

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted,
depending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)
will occur at the end of the semester.  

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    

------------------------------------------

Attendance
----------
Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused).
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) **seven**
absences in total, and you must
<a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 244:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">email
the instructor</a>
if/when you must miss a class.
Each additional absence, and any absence not mentioned to the instructor,
may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.

Occasionally attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in
sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. If another student asks
you to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature
constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to
the UH Office of Judicial Affairs.

**Important:** If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.

------------------------------------------

Asking Questions
----------------
Students are strongly encouraged to ask lots of questions.
If you don't understand something, please say so!

1. **In Lecture.** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **On Piazza.** Another good place to ask a question is the online discussion
   forum.
   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students
   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].

   This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
   classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the
   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). 

   Our class Piazza page is at: https://piazza.com/hawaii/fall2016/math244/home

------------------------------------------

Email Policy
------------
You may email the instructor directly, though the response
time will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.

If you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 244:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">this
link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should
pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least
indicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.

-------------------------------

Classroom Policy and Code of Conduct
------------------------------------
Students must abide by the university's [student conduct code](http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/proscribed_conduct.php).
In particular, Cheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy
will be referred to and dealt with by the UH Office of Judicial Affairs in a
manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to
expulsion from the university.

------------------------------------------

Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.
Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for example, is totally
unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to focus on what is
being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting to other
students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated 
to math will not be tolerated.**

-------------------------------------

Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy
will be referred to and dealt with by the UH Office of Judicial Affairs, in a
manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to
expulsion from the university.


-------------------------------------------------------

Students With Disabilities
--------------------------
Students who have a documented disability, or who believe they have 
a disability that qualifies under the Americans with Disabilities Act and
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and requires accommodations, 
should contact the Kokua office for students with disabilities.
